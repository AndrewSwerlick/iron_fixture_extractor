  TODO: RETHINK THIS for v1.1.0
* Help on the missing features above would be much appreciated per the
usual github approach:

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Ensure the test cases run
4. Copy one of the test cases (like basic_test.rb), rename, rip out the guts, and add some tests + code to the app
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Added some feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
7. Create new Pull Request

If you have other ideas for this tool, make a Github Issue.
